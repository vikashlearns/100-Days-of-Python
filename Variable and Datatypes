Variables - (data Stored in Memory Locations)
Why do we store data in Memory location ?
- Because we want to manipulate it throughtout the program

String - to store a name or piece of text
Integer - Age 
Float - CGPA

Variable is created the moment you assign a value using Assignment Operator
(=)

Dynamically Typed language - 
age=34 (integer)
name="Harry" (String)
cgpa=4.8 ( Floating)


Statically type language - need a explictly declaration of variable  ( C)

#Rule of defining a variable in Python
Variable names must start with a letter (a-z,A-z) or an underscore (_)
They can contain letters , numbers and underscore
Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different)
Avoid using Python Keywords as variable (if , for , while) as variable names

Python supports serveral built in data types:
Integers (int) - whole number 
Floats (float) - Decimal numbers
String (str) - Text data enclosed in quotes ""
Booleans (bool)- Represent true or false
Lists -  Ordered, mutable collections ([1,2,3])
Tuples - Ordered immutable collections ( (1,2,3) ) (immutable - you cannot change)
Sets - Unordered collections of unique elements ( {1,2,3} )
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs ( {"name": "Alice", "age"; 25})


Type Casting - Changing 1 datatype to other

b=int(a) 

int(): Converts to integer.
float(): Converts to float.
str(): Converts to string.
bol(): Converts to bolean.

How can we take user input in python ?
using input() - allow to take user input from keyboard
-by default returns an str
a=int( input("Enter first number"))
b=int(input("Enter second number"))
# int(a=int(a)
# b=int(b)
print(a+b)


comments, Escape Sequence & print 

Comments - used to explain code and ignored by python interpretor

ctrl+ / - to remove/add comments (#)

''' or """ = to write multi level comments 

Escape Sequence - 
are used to include special characters in string 

\n: Newline
t: Tab
\: Backslash
\": Double quote
\': Single quote

Print statement - to display output output

can use sep and end parameters to customize the output
