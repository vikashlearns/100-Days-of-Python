Variables - (data Stored in Memory Locations)
Why do we store data in Memory location ?
- Because we want to manipulate it throughtout the program

String - to store a name or piece of text
Integer - Age 
Float - CGPA

Variable is created the moment you assign a value using Assignment Operator
(=)

Dynamically Typed language - 
age=34 (integer)
name="Harry" (String)
cgpa=4.8 ( Floating)


Statically type language - need a explictly declaration of variable  ( C)

#Rule of defining a variable in Python
Variable names must start with a letter (a-z,A-z) or an underscore (_)
They can contain letters , numbers and underscore
Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different)
Avoid using Python Keywords as variable (if , for , while) as variable names
